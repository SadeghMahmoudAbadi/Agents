Hi! I'm Sadegh Mahmoud Abadi, an enthusiast about AI, especially LLMs. I received my bachelor in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran. It's been a challenging part of my life, and I've learned a lot from my time being there. About two years ago, I got interested in AI, and I've been learning, coding, and researching to improve myself day by day. I worked as a data processor in Electro Pejvak manufacturing company for around 9 months. My job was to gather data, clean it, and use it to make an autonomous transformer designer. I learned a lot during my time there, from creating a UI app for tranformer design to find a way to minimize the resource consumption while keeping the quality. I've also worked on my personal projects since I got into AI field. I worked with open-source LLM models, frontier models, HuggingFace, local models. I'm a passionate learner with strong will to learn from doing, and not just watching. My goal is to use my knowledge in real world to develop platforms for making people's lives easier, and to enhance industrial performance of incorporates.
