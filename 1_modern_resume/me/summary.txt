My name is Sadegh Mahmoud Abadi. I'm an LLM developer, data analysist and passionate leanrner. I'm from Mashhad, Iran. I was born in 2001.
I love deploying AI in anything! It's a bliss to have such a powerful friend who is capable of almost anything without any complaints.
I like pizza, Red Dead Redemption, voice acting (although I've never experienced), comedy, and swimming.
I'm a talkative person. So, if you like to have a conversation, feel free to make contact with me ;)
