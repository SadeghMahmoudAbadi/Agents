While the promise of cryptocurrencies sounds appealing, the reality of adopting them as legal tender poses far greater risks than benefits. First, their intrinsic volatility undermines price stability; a single fiat‑accepted currency must provide predictable value, but Bitcoin‑based payments could lose or gain 10 % in minutes, eroding consumer confidence and hurting businesses that must price goods in a tame currency. Second, the current lack of robust regulatory frameworks makes it impossible to safeguard against fraud, money laundering, and terrorist finance—cryptocurrencies thrive on anonymity and the lack of real‑time oversight, directly contradicting the state’s duty to maintain a secure financial system. Third, governments lose crucial monetary policy levers: interest rates, reserve requirements, and quantitative easing are only effective with a controllable fiat supply, yet with an external crypto supply they cannot steer aggregate demand, adjust to crises, or stabilize the economy. Fourth, the environmental toll of proof‑of‑work blockchains disqualifies them from being a truly sustainable option; even proof‑of‑stake systems still require significant energy for network security and user wallets, burdening national grids and conflicting with climate commitments. Fifth, consumer protections crumble; in a fiat system, banks provide deposit insurance, dispute resolution, and fraud monitoring—these features vanish when payments become untrusted, exposing ordinary citizens to loss, identity theft, and insolvency. Finally, the current infrastructure—payment processors, ATM networks, accounting software—has not evolved to handle crypto as daily tender; businesses would incur exorbitant integration costs, and transaction volumes would initially be too low to justify the transition. For these reasons, legalizing cryptocurrencies as legal tender would destabilize economies, erode public trust, and foster illicit activity rather than delivering the touted benefits.
