Accepting cryptocurrencies as legal tender is a profound abdication of a nation's core fiscal and monetary duty. Legal tender is fundamentally required to serve as a reliable unit of account and store of value. The inherent, acute volatility of decentralized cryptocurrencies renders them disastrous for these essential functions; they cannot be reliably used for setting wages, long-term contracts, or stable pricing, instantly introducing paralyzing risk into everyday commerce and crippling savings. Furthermore, granting this status dismantles the state’s necessary oversight mechanisms. Cryptocurrencies provide a direct pipeline for massive illicit finance, evading Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) protocols, and severely complicating tax collection. By adopting a system that is, by design, uncontrollable and unbacked, countries lose the ability to manage macroeconomic policy, ceding monetary sovereignty and inviting systemic instability in exchange for speculative novelty. We must prioritize economic stability and regulatory integrity over unproven, high-risk digital assets.
